At the age of 19, Henry Darger, a self-taught artist, started working on his magnum opus, an epic literary work replete with sketches. In What is known as the Realms of the Imaginary, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Triggered by the Child Slave Revolt, the final work, known by the title The Story of the Vivian Children, amounted to over 15,000 single-spaced pages and 300 manuscript drawings.
      </p>
   <p>
The work was loosely based on the Civil War events, but recast as emancipated heroes with children; it dealt with themes of innocence, slavery, devastation, and the eventual victory of good over evil. For the majority of his life, Darger lived a lonely and even reclusive life as a janitor in a Chicago hospital. His creative output was discovered not until after his death.   </p>
    <p> Darger's art also has been featured in many notable museum exhibitions, including "The Unreality of Being" exhibit curated by Stephen Prokopoff. It was also seen in "Disasters of War" (P.S. 1, New York, 2000), where it was presented alongside prints from the famous Francisco Goya series The Disasters of War and works derived from these by the British contemporary-art duo Jake and Dinos Chapman. Darger's work has also been shown at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Setagaya Art Museum, and the Collection de l'art brut, La Maison Rouge, Museum Kunstpalast, Musée d'Art Moderne de Lille-Métropole, and the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.</p>
<p>Darger's works are included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the American Folk Art Museum in New York, Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Collection de l'art brut, the Walker Art Center, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, High Museum of Art, and the Lille Métropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art in Villeneuve d'Ascq, and the Museum of Old and New Art, in Tasmania; Australia.

     In 2008, the exhibition entitled "Dargerism: Contemporary Artists and Henry Darger" at the American Folk Art Museum examined the influence of Darger's on 11 artists, including Trenton Doyle Hancock, Robyn O'Neil and Amy Cutler, who responded not only to the aesthetic nature of the mythical work of Darger, with his tales of good versus evil, his epic scope and complexity, and his transgressive undertone.
   </p>
   <p>
     Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art in Chicago also opened its permanent Henry Darger Room Collection exhibit in 2008, an installation that meticulously recreates the small apartment on the north side of Chicago where Darger lived and made his art.
