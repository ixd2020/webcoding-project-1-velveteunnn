   Henry Darger, a self-taught artist, began working on his magnum opus, an epic work of literature replete with drawings, at the age of 19. The final work, known by the title The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion, totaled over 15,000 single-spaced pages and 300 paintings as a manuscript. The work was based loosely on the events of the Civil War, but recast with children as emancipated heroes; it addressed issues of innocence, slavery, destruction, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil. Darger led a solitary and even reclusive life as a janitor in a Chicago hospital for the majority of his life. It was not until after his death that his artistic production was discovered.
