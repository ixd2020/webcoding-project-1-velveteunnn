At the age of 19, Henry Darger, a self-taught artist, started working on his magnum opus, an epic literary work replete with sketches. In What is known as the Realms of the Imaginary, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Triggered by the Child Slave Revolt, the final work, known by the title The Story of the Vivian Children, amounted to over 15,000 single-spaced pages and 300 manuscript drawings. The work was based loosely on the events of the Civil War, but recast with children as emancipated heroes; it tackled themes of innocence, slavery, devastation, and the eventual victory of good over evil. For the majority of his life, Darger lived a lonely and even reclusive life as a janitor in a Chicago hospital. His creative output was discovered not until after his death.
