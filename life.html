His work 's visual subject ranges from idyllic scenes in Edwardian interiors and quiet flowered landscapes inhabited by children and incredible animals, to scenes of hideous horror and carnage portraying tortured and massacred young children.[3]:106 Much of his work of art is mixed media with elements of collage. One of the most celebrated examples of outsider art has been Darger's artwork.
