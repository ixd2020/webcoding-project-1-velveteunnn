At the age of 19, Henry Darger, a self-taught artist, started working on his magnum opus, an epic literary work replete with sketches. In What is known as the Realms of the Imaginary, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Triggered by the Child Slave Revolt, the final work, known by the title The Story of the Vivian Children, amounted to over 15,000 single-spaced pages and 300 manuscript drawings. The work was based loosely on the events of the Civil War, but recast with children as emancipated heroes; it tackled themes of innocence, slavery, devastation, and the eventual victory of good over evil. For the majority of his life, Darger lived a lonely and even reclusive life as a janitor in a Chicago hospital. His creative output was discovered not until after his death.

Henry Joseph Darger Jr. (/ˈdɑːrɡər/; c. April 12, 1892-April 13, 1973) was an American author, novelist and artist who worked in Chicago , Illinois, as a hospital custodian.[1] He became famous in What Is Known as the Realms of the Surreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm, Caa, for his posthumously discovered 15,145-page, single-spaced fantasy manuscript called The Tale of the Vivian Girls 
His work 's visual subject ranges from idyllic scenes in Edwardian interiors and quiet flowered landscapes inhabited by children and incredible animals, to scenes of hideous horror and carnage portraying tortured and massacred young children.[3]:106 Much of his work of art is mixed media with elements of collage. One of the most celebrated examples of outsider art has been Darger's artwork.
